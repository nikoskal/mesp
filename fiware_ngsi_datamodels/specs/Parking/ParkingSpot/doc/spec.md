# Parking Spot

## Description

A parking spot is an area well delimited where _one_ vehicle can be parked. The
aim of this entity type is to monitor the status of parking spots individually.
Thus, an entity of type `ParkingSpot` cannot exist without a containing entity
of type (`OnStreetParking`, `OffStreetParking`). A parking spot might belong to
_one_ group.

## Data Model

The data model is defined as shown below:

- `id` : Entity's unique identifier.

- `type` : Entity type. It must be equal to `ParkingSpot`.

- `dateCreated` : Entity creation date.

  - Attribute type: [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime)
  - Read-Only. Automatically generated.

- `dateModified` : Last update timestamp of this entity.

  - Attribute type: [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime)
  - Read-Only. Automatically generated.

- `name` : Name of this parking spot. It can denote the number or label used
    to identify it within a parking site.

  - Normative References: [https://schema.org/name](https://schema.org/name)
  - Optional

- `description` : Description about the parking spot.

  - Normative References:
        [https://schema.org/description](https://schema.org/description)

      - Optional
  - `TimeInstant` :
    [Timestamp](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib#TimeInstant)
    saved by FIWARE's IoT Agents. Note: This attribute has not been harmonized
    to keep backwards compatibility with current FIWARE reference implementations.
    - Type: [DateTime]((https://schema.org/DateTime). here can
    be production environmments where the attribute type is equal to the
    `ISO8601` string. If so, it must be considered as a synonym of `DateTime`.
    - Optional

  - Optional

- `length` : Length of the parking spot.

    simplification purposes only one group is allowed per parking spot.
  - Attribute type: Reference to an entity of type `ParkingGroup`.
  - Optional

- `refParkingSite` : Parking site to which the the parking spot belongs to.

  - Attribute type: Reference to an entity of type `OnStreetParking` or type
        `OffStreetParking`, depending on the value of the `category` attribute.
  - Mandatory

- `category` : Category(ies) of the parking spot.

    [Timestamp](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib#TimeInstant)
    saved by FIWARE's IoT Agent. Note: This attribute has not been harmonized to
    keep backwards compatibility with current FIWARE reference
    implementations.
  - Attribute type: [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime).
    There can be production environmments where the attribute type is equal to
    the `ISO8601` string. If so, it must be considered as a synonym of
    `DateTime`.
  - Optional

- `refDevice` : The device representing the physical sensor used to monitor
    this parking spot.
  - Attribute type: Reference to entity of type
        [Device](../../../Device/Device/doc/spec.md)
  - Optional

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
