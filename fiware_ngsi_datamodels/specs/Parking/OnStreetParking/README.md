# Street parking

This folder holds all the code needed to support datasets which expose
`StreetParking` instances as NGSIv2.

The list below provides a description of the files present in this folder:

-   `data-parking.csv`.- It is a snapshot of the parking sensors provided by the
    SmartSantander project.
-   `parking.js`.- Allows to obtain the former snapshot by querying an instance
    of Orion Context Broker.
-   `parking_polygons.geojson`.- It is a vector layer with the different street
    parking areas (modelled as polygons).
-   `sensors_polygons.csv` .- A data layer which keeps the correspondence
    between parking sensors and its containing polygon.
-   `setup-santander.js`.- This script sets up all the configuration and
    entities for supporting street parking areas in Santander
-   `auxiliary` .- This folder contains auxiliary stuff (GIS layers) which have
    been used to generate the artefacts described above.
-   `santander.js`.- This server subscribes to parking sensor status changes and
    updates the corresponding `StreetParking` entity.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
