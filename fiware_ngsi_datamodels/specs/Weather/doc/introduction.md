# Weather Harmonized Data Models

These data models describe entities useful for dealing with weather data. These
entities are primarily associated with the vertical segments of the environment
and agriculture but is applicable to many different applications.

The main entities identified are:

-   [WeatherForecast](../WeatherForecast/doc/spec.md). It represents a weather
    forecast for a period of time and a location.
-   [WeatherObserved](../WeatherObserved/doc/spec.md). It represents a weather
    observation made over a period of time at a specific location.

*   [WeatherAlert](../WeatherAlert/doc/spec.md). It represents a weather alarm
    intended to raise attention over a forecasted extreme weather condition.
