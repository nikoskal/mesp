# Weather Observed

Weather observed from the [Spanish National Meteorology Agency](http://aemet.es)
(AEMET) is exposed through NGSIv2. The Weather observed is provided by
[weather stations](../../PointOfInterest/WeatherStation) owned by AEMET and by
the IPMA (Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere).

This folder contains the following scripts:

-   `weather_observed.py` .- Contains all the logic to expose the weather
    observed as an NGSIv2 data model (outdated).
-   `spain_weather_observed_harvest.py` .- Performs data harvesting using
    AEMET's data site as origin and Orion Context Broker as destination.
-   `portugal_weather_observed_harvest.py` .- Performs data harvesting using
    IPMA's data site as origin and Orion Context Broker as destination.

Please check data licenses at the original data sources before using this data
in an application.

## Public instance

To get access to a public instance offering weather observed data please have a
look at the
[GSMA's API Directory](http://apidirectory.connectedliving.gsma.com).

The instance described
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHP7XS-7TNzsxLa0bNFb-96JnJXh0ecIHS3-H0qMREg/edit?usp=sharing)
has been set up by the FIWARE Community.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
