# Parks and gardens datamodels

These data models are intended to model parks, gardens and related green spaces
in a city.

The main entity types identified are:

-   [Park](http://schema.org/Park). A park is an area of open space provided for
    recreational use, usually designed and in semi-natural state with grassy
    areas, trees and bushes. Parks are often but not always municipal. Typically
    open to the public, but may be fenced off, and may be temporarily closed
    e.g. at night time.
    [See OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure%3Dpark).
    Schema.org already provides an entity type for this purpose which can be
    reused.

-   [Garden](../Garden/doc/spec.md). A garden is a distinguishable planned
    space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, and
    enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. A garden can incorporate both
    natural and man-made materials. Western gardens are almost universally based
    on plants. A garden can also be a part of a park and open to the public.
    [See OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure%3Dgarden).
    A garden can be divided into several smaller parts, named flower beds
    (`parterres` in Spanish).

-   [FlowerBed](../FlowerBed/doc/spec.md). A garden plot in which flowers (or
    other plants) are grown. Usually you will find flower beds in parks,
    gardens, pedestrian areas or at big highway interchanges.
    [See OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/flowerbed)

-   [GreenspaceRecord](../GreenspaceRecord/doc/spec.md). This entity contains a
    harmonised description of the conditions recorded on a particular area or
    point inside a garden or related green space. Such record can be associated
    to a garden, to an specific flower bed, etc.

New entities pending to be defined:

-   `WateringPoint` . To model watering points and how they could be controlled
    by means of IoT.
-   `GreenSpaceOperation` . To model operations to be done on green spaces in a
    city. Operations can be watering, fertilization, pesticide drop, etc.
