# Road

## Description

This entity contains a harmonised geographic and contextual description of a
road. Roads are made up of one or more
[RoadSegment](../../RoadSegment/doc/spec.md) entities. Road segments are usually
used to model the different carriageways of highways, for instance. The presence
of dedicated bicycle lanes should be modelled using road segments as well. Road
segments also play an important role when modelling roads with heterogeneous
segments, for instance segments on which speed limits are different.

This entity is primarily associated with the Automotive and Smart City vertical
segments and related IoT applications.

This data model has been developed in cooperation with mobile operators and the
[GSMA](http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/iot-big-data/).

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
