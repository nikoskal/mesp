# Building

## Description

This entity contains a harmonised description of a Building. This entity is
associated with the vertical segments of smart homes, smart cities, industry and
related IoT applications.

This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
operators and the [GSMA](http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/iot-big-data/),
compared to GSMA data model following changes are introduced:

-   the reference to `BuildingType` is removed, since `BuildingType` compared to
    `category` attribute does not introduce significant information.

-   `category` attribute is required.

-   `openingHours` is introduced following schema.org data model to allow
    fine-grained on building opening times. GSMA supported this as free text in
    the `notes` attribute (removed as well).

-   `refSubscriptionService` is not supported, since `SubscriptionService` model
    is not supported currently.

API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).
