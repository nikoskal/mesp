# Device

## Description

An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a
particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.). A Device is a
tangible object which contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of
data. A Device is always assumed to be capable of communicating electronically
via a network.

This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
operators and the [GSMA](http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/iot-big-data/).

This data model reuses concepts coming from the
[SAREF Ontology](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/01.01.01_60/ts_103264v010101p.pdf)
part of [ETSI](http://www.etsi.org) standards.

## Data Model

The data model is defined as shown below:

-   `id` : Unique identifier.

-   `type` : Entity type. It must be equal to `Device`.

-   `category` : See attribute `category` from
    [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Optional but recommended to
    optimize queries.

-   `controlledProperty` : See attribute `controlledProperty` from
    [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Optional but recommended to
    optimize queries.

-   `controlledAsset` : The asset(s) (building, object, etc.) controlled by the
    device.

    -   Attribute type: List of [Text](https://schema.org) or Reference(s) to
        another entity.
    -   Optional

-   `mnc` : This property identifies the Mobile Network Code (MNC) of the
    network the device is attached to. The MNC is used in combination with a
    Mobile Country Code (MCC) (also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple") to uniquely
    identify a mobile phone operator/carrier using the GSM, CDMA, iDEN, TETRA
    and 3G / 4G public land mobile networks and some satellite mobile
    networks. + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text) + Optional

-   `mcc` : Mobile Country Code - This property identifies univoquely the
    country of the mobile network the device is attached to.

    -   Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    -   Optional

-   `macAddress` : The MAC address of the device.

    -   Attribute type: List of [Text](https://schema.org/Text)

    of values if the device has more than one IP address.

    -   Attribute type: List of [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    -   Optional

-   `supportedProtocol` : See attribute `supportedProtocol` from
    [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Needed if due to a software
    update new protocols are supported. Otherwise it is better to convey it at
    `DeviceModel` level.

-   `configuration` : Device's technical configuration. This attribute is
    intended to be a dictionary of properties which capture parameters which
    have to do with the configuration of a device (timeouts, reporting periods,
    etc.) and which are not currently covered by the standard attributes defined
    by this model. + Attribute type:
    [StructuredValue](https://schema.org/StructuredValue) + Attribute
    metadata: + `dateModified` : Last update timestamp of this attribute. +

    type point.

    -   Attribute type: `geo:json`.

-   `value` : A observed or reported value. For actuator devices, it is an
    attribute that allows a controlling application to change the actuation
    setting. For instance, a switch device which is currently _on_ can report a
    value `"on"`of type `Text`. Obviously, in order to toggle the referred
    switch, this attribute value will have to be changed to `"off"`. + Attribute
    type: Any type, depending on the device. Usually
    [Text](https://schema.org/Text) or
    [QuantitativeValue](https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue). + Attribute

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).

## Examples

    {
      "id": "device-9845A",
      "type": "Device",
      "category": ["sensor"],
      "controlledProperty": ["fillingLevel","temperature"],
      "controlledAsset": ["wastecontainer-Osuna-100"],
      "ipAddress": ["192.14.56.78"],
      "mcc": "214",
      "mnc": "07",
      "batteryLevel": 0.75,
      "serialNumber": "9845A",
      "refDeviceModel": "myDevice-wastecontainer-sensor-345",
      "value": "l=0.22;t=21.2",
      "deviceState": "ok",
      "dateFirstUsed": "2014-09-11T11:00:00Z",
      "owner": ["http://person.org/leon"]
    }

**N.B.:** This example to work in Orion Context Broker implementation of NGSI
v2, requires that value attribute is URL Encoded. As documented
[here](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/forbidden_characters/index.html)
`=` is a forbidden character.

## Test it with a real service

T.B.D.

## Issues

-   Is `function` really needed?
-   Do we need a `state` attribute as it happens in SAREF?
-   Check consistency with oneM2M and SAREF ontologies.
