To get access to a public instance offering air quality observed data please
have a look at the
[GSMA's API Directory](http://apidirectory.connectedliving.gsma.com/api/air-quality-spain).

The instance described
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHP7XS-7TNzsxLa0bNFb-96JnJXh0ecIHS3-H0qMREg/edit?usp=sharing)
has been set up by the FIWARE Community.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
