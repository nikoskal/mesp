# Civic Issue Tracking data models

These data models allow to perform civic issue tracking. They have been designed
with a view to enabling trivial interoperability between FIWARE NGSI version 2
and [Open311](http://www.open311.org/). As a result, property names have not
been normalized to the `camelCase`syntax, they remain as currently specified by
Open311. That is the rationale behind naming entity types with `Open311` as
prefix. However, a few properties are added, so that FIWARE NGSI version 2
implementations can properly store and serve Open 311 data.

FIWARE and OASC, in the medium term, might propose to the Open311 Community a
harmonized data model aligned with the rest of FIWARE data models and
schema.org. In fact, using these data models and a FIWARE NGSI version 2
implementation it is trivial to implement the APIs proposed by Open311. Another
option would be the use of [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) to define equivalencies
and mappings between a FIWARE / Schema.org data model and Open 311.

The FIWARE NGSI civic issue tracking data model defines the following entity
types:

-   [Open311:ServiceType](../Open311_ServiceType/doc/spec.md). A type of service
    a citizen can request. It encompasses data from the Open 311 GET Service
    List and GET Service Definition.
-   [Open311:ServiceRequest](../Open311_ServiceRequest/doc/spec.md). A specific
    service request (of a service type) made by a citizen.
