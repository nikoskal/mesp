# Alert
This entity models an alert and could be used to send alerts related to traffic jam, accidents, weather conditions, high level of pollutants and so on. The purpose of the model is to support the generation of notifications for a user or trigger other actions, based on such alerts.

An alert is generated by a specific situation. The main features of an alert is that it is not predictable and it is not a recurrent data. That means that an alert could be an accident or a high level of pollutants measure, additionally it could be the fall down of a patient or a car driving in the opposite direction.

Some examples of context data are: type of alert (traffic, suspicious activities, and pollution, etc.), severity, location and so on.
This entity contains a harmonised description of an Alert. This entity provides an essentially static description of a generic device and is therefore applicable to all IoT segments and related IoT applications.

This is defined by NTUA.
