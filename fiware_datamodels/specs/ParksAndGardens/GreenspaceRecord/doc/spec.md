# GreenspaceRecord

## Description

This entity contains a harmonised description of the conditions recorded on a
particular area or point inside a greenspace (flower bed, garden, etc.). This
entity type has been inspired by the `AgriParcelRecord` entity type defined by
the GSMA Harmonized Data Models.

    Conductivity, EC in units of Siemens per meter (S/m).

    -   Attribute type: [Number](https://schema.org/Number)
    -   Default unit: Siemens per meter (S/m).
    -   Attribute metadata:
        -   `timestamp` : optional timestamp for the observed value. It can be
            omitted if the observation time is the same as the one captured by
            the `dateObserved` attribute at entity level.
    -   Optional

-   `refGreenspace` : The garden or flower bed to which this record refers to.

    -   Attribute type: Reference to an entity of type `Garden` or `FlowerBed`.
    -   Optional

-   `refDevice` : The device or devices used to obtain the data expressed by
    this record.
    -   Attribute type: Reference to an entity of type `Device`
    -   Optional

### Representing related weather conditions

There are two options for representing weather conditions (air temperature,
humidity, etc.) observed at the area:

-   A/ Through a linked entity of type `WeatherObserved` (attribute named
    `refWeatherObserved`).
-   B/ Through a group of weather-related properties already defined by
    [WeatherObserved](../../../Weather/WeatherObserved/doc/spec.md).

Below is the description of the attribute to be used for option A/.

-   `refWeatherObserved` : Weather observed associated to the measurements
    described by this entity.
    -   Attribute type: Reference to a
        [WeatherObserved](../../../Weather/WeatherObserved/doc/spec.md) entity.
    -   Optional

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).

## Examples of use
