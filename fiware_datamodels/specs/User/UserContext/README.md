# UserContext

This data model describe the Context of a User. No personal data is encoded in
the model. The actual User data are stored in a different end point, as
identified by the `refUser` property.

**Note**: JSON Schemas only capture the NGSI simplified representation, this
means that to test the JSON schema examples with a
[FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable)
API implementation, you need to use the `keyValues` mode (`options=keyValues`).

## Examples of use

    ]
  },
  "refActivity": "UserActivity1",
